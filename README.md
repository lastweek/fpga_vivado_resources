# Vivado Resources

A collection of my own FPGA-related repos.
Some were cloned from official repos and some were built by myself.
I am, by no means an FPGA programming expert.
In fact I found FPGA programming extremely hard and unsatisfying.
However, I want to keep track of the good resources I've came across.
If it was not for my research project, I would not started using FPGA.

## Submodules

Scripts:

- `XilinxTclStore`. Many useful scripts from Xilinx.
- `fpga_vivado_scripts_pr`. Non-project scripts for partial reconfiguration flow.

Software:

- `fpga_vivado_embeddedsw`: MicroBlaze system layer code from Xilinx.

Bitstream:

- `fpga_interpret_bitstream`. Simple program to interpret bitstream format.
